# âš¡ HTTP Interceptor

A modern HTTP traffic interceptor and modifier. Tired of using BurpSuite's outdated UI to modify requests? Me too! This project implements a UI that matches
the experience of Chrome's DevTools, so you can feel right at home!

### View all traffic going in and out of your browser
